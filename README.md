A Django web application that allows users to manage their recipes with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. It features user authentication to ensure that only logged-in users can add, update, or delete recipes.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in to manage recipes.
- **Recipe Management**: Logged-in users can add new recipes, update existing ones, or delete them.
- **Secure Access**: Recipe management features are protected by authentication to ensure only authorized users can make changes.
- **SQLite Database**: Uses Django's default SQLite database for storing user credentials and recipe data.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend logic and data processing.
- **Django**: Framework for building the web application.
- **SQLite**: Default database used by Django for local development (no additional configuration required).
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend for creating user interfaces and displaying data.
